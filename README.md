# CherryBlossomGrotto
A Minecraft mod using the 1.19.3 version of the MC Forge framework.
Uses [Terrablender](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrablender) as a dependency for generating custom biomes.

# Contents
The main focus of this mod is the cherry blossom grotto that it adds to the Minecraft overworld.
This biome includes a new type of cherry blossom tree and a new style of villages with a Japanese design.
Iron ore generates much more sparcely in this new biome.
Mossy cobblestone generates naturally in this biome as well, similar to how it does in some vanilla biomes.
There are also torii gates and giant buddha statues that generate in multiple vanilla biomes as well as the cherry blossom grotto biome.
Cherry Blossom Grottos have their own variant of the ruined nether portal structure which is designed to looked like a ruined portal inside of a torii gate.
Cherry blossom grotto villages are the one place where the new koi fish entity can be found. Villagers in these villages will also have new looks!

Cherry Blossom trees also spawn in two new biomes as part of the Cherry Blossom Slopes and Cherry Blossom Bamboo Jungle biomes.
These two biomes take biomes similar to those found in vanilla Minecraft and intersperse cherry blossom trees into them.
The slopes biome is a snowy mountainside biome with sparse cherry blossom trees.
The bamboo jungle biome is a typical bamboo jungle but interspersed with cherry blossom trees.

# Extra Support
### Motschen's Better Leaves support
For adding support for cherry blossom leaves with [Motschen's Better Leaves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/motschens-better-leaves) - follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Dekunutter/cherryblossomgrotto-betterleaves).

### BSL shaders waving leaves support
If you want to see the cherry blossom leave blocks wave like other leave blocks when the [BSL shaderpack's](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/bsl-shaders) waving leaves option is enabled, you'll need to make a small edit to the shaderpack manually.
Assuming you already have BSL shaders installed and working, navigate to your shaderpacks folder in your Minecraft installation directory and follow through to:
1. BSL_vX.X.XX > shaders > block.properties
2. Open **block.properties** in a text editor.
3. Look for the line containing _"block.10105= \"_ and you'll see the following line contains a list of all leave blocks from vanilla minecraft that the shaderpack recognizes.
4. On this line, add a space to the end and enter _"cherryblossomgrotto:cherry_blossom_leaves"_ to add the cherry blossom leaves block to the list of leave blocks recognized by the shaderpack. 
5. You should now be able to launch Minecraft with BSL shaders and see the cherry blossom leave blocks waving alongside vanilla Minecraft leave blocks.
