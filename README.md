# Eastward Journeys
A Forge mod for Minecraft that adds asian-themed content to the game.

# Dependencies
Uses [Terrablender](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrablender) as a dependency for generating custom biomes.
Also uses [GeckoLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib) for entity animations.

# Contents
This mod is a sequel to the Cherry Blossom Grotto mod. Now that cherry blossoms are natively supported by Minecraft (as of 1.20), this mod shifts its focus into the support of new biomes themed around the nature of eastern asia.
Minecraft's vanilla cherry blossom trees will now show up in some new biomes in place of the original mod's own take on cherry blossom trees.
The mod itself has a range of new content from biomes, custom villages, new structures, items and building blocks.

# Extra Support
### Motschen's Better Leaves support
For adding support for cherry blossom leaves with [Motschen's Better Leaves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/motschens-better-leaves) - follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Dekunutter/eastwardjourneys-betterleaves).

### BSL shaders waving leaves support
If you want to see the cherry blossom leave blocks wave like other leave blocks when the [BSL shaderpack's](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/bsl-shaders) waving leaves option is enabled, you'll need to make a small edit to the shaderpack manually.
Assuming you already have BSL shaders installed and working, navigate to your shaderpacks folder in your Minecraft installation directory and follow through to:
1. BSL_vX.X.XX > shaders > block.properties
2. Open **block.properties** in a text editor.
3. Look for the line containing _"block.10105= \"_ and you'll see the following line contains a list of all leave blocks from vanilla minecraft that the shaderpack recognizes.
4. On this line, add a space to the end and enter _"eastwardjourneys:cherry_blossom_leaves"_ to add the cherry blossom leaves block to the list of leave blocks recognized by the shaderpack. 
5. You should now be able to launch Minecraft with BSL shaders and see the cherry blossom leave blocks waving alongside vanilla Minecraft leave blocks.
