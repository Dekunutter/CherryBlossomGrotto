# CherryBlossomGrotto
A Minecraft mod using the 1.20 version of the MC Forge framework.
Uses [Terrablender](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrablender) as a dependency for generating custom biomes.
Also uses [GeckoLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib) for entity animations.

# Contents
This mod is a sequel to the Cherry Blossom Grotto mod. Now that cherry blossoms are natively supported by Minecraft, this mod shifts its focus into the support of new biomes themed around the nature of eastern asia.
The cherry blossom trees will now show up in some new biomes and a new style of village with a Japanese design will also spawn in these locations.
On top of this, new biomes like the Maple Woods and the Stone Forest, alongside new structures like the Great Wall provide a selection of new content thats unlike what Minecraft has provided before!

# Extra Support
### Motschen's Better Leaves support
For adding support for cherry blossom leaves with [Motschen's Better Leaves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/motschens-better-leaves) - follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Dekunutter/cherryblossomgrotto-betterleaves).

### BSL shaders waving leaves support
If you want to see the cherry blossom leave blocks wave like other leave blocks when the [BSL shaderpack's](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/bsl-shaders) waving leaves option is enabled, you'll need to make a small edit to the shaderpack manually.
Assuming you already have BSL shaders installed and working, navigate to your shaderpacks folder in your Minecraft installation directory and follow through to:
1. BSL_vX.X.XX > shaders > block.properties
2. Open **block.properties** in a text editor.
3. Look for the line containing _"block.10105= \"_ and you'll see the following line contains a list of all leave blocks from vanilla minecraft that the shaderpack recognizes.
4. On this line, add a space to the end and enter _"cherryblossomgrotto:cherry_blossom_leaves"_ to add the cherry blossom leaves block to the list of leave blocks recognized by the shaderpack. 
5. You should now be able to launch Minecraft with BSL shaders and see the cherry blossom leave blocks waving alongside vanilla Minecraft leave blocks.
